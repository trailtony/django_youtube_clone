# Logs Directory

This directory contains application log files generated by the Django YouTube clone application.

## Log Files

- **django.log** - General application logs (INFO level and above)
- **errors.log** - Error logs only (ERROR level)
- **video_uploads.log** - Detailed video upload operation logs

## Log Rotation

All log files are automatically rotated when they reach 5 MB in size. The system keeps:
- 5 backup files for django.log and errors.log
- 3 backup files for video_uploads.log

## Viewing Logs

```

### On Unix/Linux/Mac
```bash
# View last 20 lines
tail -n 20 errors.log

# Monitor log file in real-time

```

## Log Format

Logs use the following format:
```
[LEVEL] timestamp module process_id thread_id message
```

Example:

```

## Important Notes

- Log files are excluded from version control (.gitignore)
- Never commit log files to the repository
- Logs may contain sensitive user information - handle with care
- Old log files are automatically deleted when backup count is exceeded
